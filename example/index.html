    	<h2>What is changing ?</h2>
    	<p>I have been using <strong>Typed.js</strong> (by <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.mattboldt.com/" target="_blank">mattboldt</a>) for some personal projects like <a class="underline-link" href="https://github.com/Gabri3l/Lands-Of-Fragar" target="_blank"><em>Lands of Fragar</em></a>. The goal was to display a console-like feedback for the player where one could read about the storyline and gather additional info about the game mechanics. The specific issue that I faced with the current implementation was that, whenever an event would trigger a new typing animation, the animation would either not start or behave oddly displaying one letter at a time. The first workaround was to just remove the element to which the animation was attached to and add it again starting a new animation. That felt clunky and not very intuitive. What I really wanted was to simply overwrite the current animation.</p>
    	<p>The old script would simply start the animation if no <em>typed</em> data was defined. Furthermore the built-in <span class="code">reset</span> function would create a <span class="code">span</span> element with the same <span class="code">id</span> of the existing one (not taking into account the use of a <span class="code">class</span> which is also fixed with my solution) and remove the old html element. In the new version there is no creation or removal of any html element, using jQuery I simply clear the element from its content and reset some vars to their default value, thus in fact resetting the script to its default state. The <span class="code">reset</span> function is only called if the element under analysis has already been used for a typing animation, otherwise everything proceeds as intended from the old version.</p>
    	<p>If you click on <em>Start New Typing</em> you will notice right away how with the old script nothing happens while the revised version will display a new message!</p>
